# Ultimate RAG Bootcamp

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey from the **Ultimate RAG Bootcamp** course, focusing on building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, and related tooling.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Build a strong foundation in RAG concepts
- Implement practical examples step by step
- Gradually refactor experiments into reusable code
- Maintain a clean and consistent GitHub learning history

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Document ingestion and parsing
- Text loaders and DirectoryLoader
- Chunking and preprocessing
- Embeddings and vector representations
- Vector stores and retrieval
- Query enhancement strategies
- Agentic RAG concepts (LangGraph, agents)
- Evaluation and improvement techniques
